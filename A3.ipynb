    "#### Overview\n",
    "For this assignment, you will be using Python and Spark to perform some graph analysis, using a graph of the Gnutella server network.   In this graph, each node represents a server, and each (directed) edge represents a connection between servers in Gnutella's peer-to-peer network.  The input file for this assignment, `p2p-Gnutella08-adj.txt`, represents the graph as an adjacency list.   Each server (node) is identified by a unique number, and each line in the file gives the adjacency list for a single server.\n",
    "For example, this line:\n",
    "> 91\t243\t1923\t2194\n",
    "\n",
    "gives the adjacency list for server `91`.   It indicates that there are edges from server `91` to servers `243`, `1923`, and `2194`.    According to the Stanford Network Analysis Project, which collected these data, [the graph includes 6301 servers and 20777 edges](http://snap.stanford.edu/data/p2p-Gnutella08.html).\n",

To get started, you should make sure that you have a clear understanding of ordinary (i.e., non-personalized) page rank.  Read the description of page rank in Section 5.3 of [the course textbook](http://mapreduce.cc/).   Personalized page rank is like ordinary page rank except:\n",
    "- One node in the graph is designated as the *source* node. Personalized page rank is performed with respect to that source node.\n",
    "- Personalized page rank is initialized by assigning all probability mass to the source node, and none to the other nodes. In contrast, ordinary page rank is initialized by giving all nodes the same probability mass.\n",
    "- Whenever personalized page rank makes a random jump, it jumps back to the source node. In contrast, ordinary page rank may jump to any node.\n",

($p_0(x)$ is the initial probability mass of node $x$.)   We define the change of $x$'s probability mass on the $i$th iteration as $\\lvert p_i(x)-p_{i-1}(x) \\rvert$.   Then, we can iterate personalized page rank until the maximum (over all nodes) change is less than a specified threshold, i.e, until all nodes' page ranks have converged.\n",

Instead of computing the same RDD multiple times, it can be computed once, cached, and then re-used from the cache.   Read about caching in the Spark textbook, or in the [persistence section of the Spark RDD programming guide](https://spark.apache.org/docs/latest/rdd-programming-guide.html#rdd-persistence).   Caching can be particularly effective for iterative Spark applications, like those you are writing for this assignment.\n",

It should only affect performance.)   Don't worry about different persistence levels.   Just use `cache()`, which caches RDDs at the default persistence level.\n",
